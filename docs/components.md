# Components

### Boots

Handles DHCP requests, hands out IPs, and serves up iPXE. It also uses the Tinkerbell client to pull and push hardware data. `boots` will only respond to a predefined set of MAC addresses so it can be deployed in an existing network without interfering with existing DHCP infrastructure.

### Osie

Installs operating systems and handles deprovisioning.

### Tinkerbell

Service responsible for processing workflows. It is comprised of a server and a CLI, which communicate over gRPC. The CLI is used to create a workflow along with its building blocks, i.e., a template hardware devices.

### Hegel

Metadata service used by Tinkerbell and Osie during provisioning. It collects data from Tinkerbell and transforms it into a JSON format to be consumed as metadata. 

### Database

We use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), also known as Postgres, as our data store. Postgres is a free and open-source relational database management system that emphasizes extensibility and technical standards compliance. It is designed to handle a range of workloads, from single machines to data warehouses or Web services with many concurrent users.

### Image Repository

Depending on your use case, you can choose to use [Quay](https://quay.io/) or [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) as the registry to store component images. You can use the same registry to store all of the action images used for a workflow. 

On the other hand, if you want to keep things local, you can also setup a secure private Docker registry to hold all your images locally. 

### Fluent Bit

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) is an open source and multi-platform Log Processor and Forwarder which allows you to collect data/logs from different sources, unify and send them to multiple destinations. The components write their logs to `stdout` and these logs are then collected by Fluent Bit and pushed to Elasticsearch. 

### Elasticsearch

[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. Fluent Bit collects the logs from each component and pushes them into Elasticsearch for storage and analysis purposes. 

### Kibana

[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack so you can do anything from tracking query load to understanding the way requests flow through your apps.
