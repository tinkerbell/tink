# Troubleshooting


### Not setting the worker to always PXE

```shell
PowerEdge R6415 - BIOS 1.8.7
A system restart is required. The system detected an exception during the UEFI
pre-boot environment.
```

Enable UEFI boot from the BIOS settings.
To enable PXE boot, execute the following commands:
```shell
$ apk add ipmitool
$ ipmitool chassis bootdev pxe
```

### No job identified for worker

```shell
Start PXE over IPv4.
  PXE-E18: Server response timeout.
Boot Failed: PXE Device 1: NIC in Slot 2 Port 1

No boot device available or Operating System detected.
Please ensure a compatible bootable media is available.
```

Ensure that you have pushed the hardware data to Tinkerbell having the correct MAC address.
You can push the data with `tink push <data-json>`.

### Can't login to private registry

```shell
Login did not succeed, error: Error response from daemon: Get https://192.168.1.1/v2/: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "crypto/rsa: verification error" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "Autogenerated CA")
```

 - verify that `hosts` list in `tinkerbell/tls/server-csr.in.json` has the registry IP or domain
 - rebuild the `certs` container and copy the `ca.pem` to `/etc/docker/certs.d/<registry-ip/domain>/ca.crt`

### Worker fails to pull images from private registry

```shell
Waiting for docker to respond...
Error response from daemon: Get https://192.168.1.1/v2/: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority (possibly because of "crypto/rsa: verification error" while trying to verify candidate authority certificate "Autogenerated CA")
```

Make sure that the `ca.pem`  file, used for hosting the private registry, is present at `<nginx-path>/misc/tinkerbell/workflow` path.
